### SPC-SF Hybrid Visualization (Bird Glyphs)

This Repository contains the code for a data visualization method I developed for the Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab at Central Washington University.

The visualization method is glyph based, and allows for the lossless and reversible visualization of high-dimensional data. I am currently developing a GUI for the method using Qt.
